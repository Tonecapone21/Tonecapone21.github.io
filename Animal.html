<p>My favorite animal is a Jaglion! A Jaglion is the cross breed between a male Jaguar and a female Lion. They have the most amazing appearance of any animal in the animal kingdom, in my opinion!</p>

	<p> I think the above site is a good one becuase it adds a lot of information and structures it well. I recognize many tags in the Source Code. I truly couldn't say that I didnt recognize one single tag, but Im still not too familiar with class types</p>
